Parental Control
-------------------------

There are other open source projects in various stages of development and
none of which cover the requirements I have.

In order to use this system right now, manual editing of the configuration
files are required. Simply edit the files in /etc/parental-time-curb/users.d
and set ENABLE to 1 in order to start tracking (and limiting) that user's
time on the computer. There are comments in the configuration files which
should be enough to get by "for now".

There will at some point be an administrative interface to configure these
things properly without needing to manually adjust anything. But we're not
there yet.

You can get the latest builds from the launchpad repo:

 sudo apt-add-repository ppa:onest8/ppa
 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install parental-time-curb
